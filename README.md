# The Peace Public License
 
The Peace Public license is a freedom-respecting sharealike license for both the author of a work as well as those subject to a work. It aims to protect the basic rights of human beings from exploitation, the earth from plunder, and the equal treatment of the workers involved in the creation of the work. It aims to ensure a copyrighted work is forever available for public use, modification, and redistribution under the same terms so long as the work is not used for harm.
